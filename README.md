comp767 class project

Instructions for submission:

Each team will make a MyCourses submission which should include a single pdf report about the project which contains:

1 - A short paper (report) summarizing the work that you have done (suggested length 4 pages), preferable in single column format, which should be organized in the following sections:
* an introduction, stating the problem you tackled, why is it an interesting problem, and any background information you deem necessary (this should be short), but descriptive.
one or two sections describing what you have done and any results. For experimental projects, you should include a link to a GitHub repo (can be private) or a notebook/colab containing the code (see details below). For theoretical projects, this is where you describe the assumptions, formalism and theoretical analysis.
* a discussion section: what have you learned, any insights, observations, what worked or did not, what is left as future work.
for people working in a team, names of all the team members and a statement of contribution, stating the work breakdown between team members.
Ideally, projects should include a reproducibility checklist (https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf) with necessary information to reproduce the proofs/results, such as a clear description of the algorithms used, hyperparameters, project dependencies, frameworks and external packages used. For example, see appendix of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01883.pdf

2 - A link to the codebase must be provided in the same report. You have multiple choices. Please ensure the codebase is accompanied with a README file and instructions to install and run it. You can host the code wherever you like as long as we are able to access it, this could be:
* A github link to the code used for empirical results, the project repo can be private, Prof. Precup (doinaprecup) and the TA’s (kkhetarpal, veronicachelu, NishanthVAnand) should be added to the project to be able to access it.
* A link to your google drive/dropbox with complete codebase. 
* 
3 - A link to a Youtube private/unlisted short spotlight video (2-3 minutes) video (video can’t be accessed by search) must be provided in the same report.  The video should explain what your project was about, what you did and what was your most interesting finding.
